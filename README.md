# Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion v2 Base on COCO Dataset

## Overview
This project aimed to fine-tune the **Stable Diffusion v2 base model** using the **COCO dataset**. The objective was to adapt the model for enhanced image generation tasks. However, due to computational limitations, the fine-tuning process could not be completed successfully. 

Attempts were also made using lightweight models, but failed.

## Challenges
- **Hardware Limitations**: 
  Fine-tuning large models like Stable Diffusion requires substantial computational power, including high-end GPUs with large memory capacity. My available hardware was insufficient for this task.
  
- **Performance of Lightweight Models**: 
  While lightweight models were explored as an alternative, they failed to meet the complexity and quality requirements of the task.

## Next Steps
To revisit this project in the future, the following strategies might be helpful:
1. **Accessing High-End Hardware**: 
   Utilize cloud-based GPU solutions such as AWS, Google Cloud, or platforms like RunPod for better computational resources.
   
2. **Optimized Fine-Tuning Techniques**: 
   Explore techniques like gradient_accumulation_steps  to reduce computational demands.
   
3. **Dataset Simplification**: 
   Use a smaller subset of the COCO dataset to lower the training complexity and computational burden.

## Lessons Learned
- Fine-tuning large-scale models requires robust hardware setups.
- Lightweight models, while resource-efficient, may not deliver satisfactory results for complex tasks.
- Parameter-efficient tuning and dataset optimization can be useful in resource-constrained scenarios.
